- **Project Description**

    - This website development project aims to increase customer relations quality. This website will operate as an
      online memo for registered customers. Registered customers can
      create their posts based on the home design they reviewed. Specifically, they can personalize their posts by
      adding pictures, website links, and captions on this new website. Moreover, they can also rate those posts they
      created to
      show their home design preferences. All the registered usersâ€™ posts will be presented on
      the Timeline page for everyone to view.
